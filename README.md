7 Aug, 2025:
I have trouble commiting an edited file to main repository.
New branch created, modified and merged succesfully (somehow). Old branch deleted.

12 Aug, 2025:
Created a separate file for experimenting on negative numbers. (Naturals Advanced.v)
Might try to implement division in Default Naturals Example.
Requires returning two values by encoding them into a single value and decoding them after return.

15 Aug, 2025:
I tried creating the base 10 number system but could only manage 0-9.
New error messages creep up whenever trying anything new.
Work halted in negative numbers for now. Will study scope next.

Discussion tab set up.
Furhtur updates might be shared there onwards.
